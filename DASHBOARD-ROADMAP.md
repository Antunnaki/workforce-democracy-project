## 📝 Notes

**Smart Local Tools Integration**: Your existing infrastructure (V34.0.0) already handles:
- Local pattern matching
- Cost-saving visualizations
- Instant responses (0ms, $0)

**Phase 1 leverages this** by:
- Processing vote statistics locally (free)
- Generating chart data locally (free)
- Only using Groq API for complex insights (rare, cheap)

**Phase 2 would add** more AI-powered features that may increase costs slightly, but still using the hybrid approach to keep costs low.
