## 🎯 Key Questions Addressed

### Top User Concerns

#### 1. **"What happens to my home's value?"**
**Answer**: Remains stable or increases. Worker democracy affects workplaces, not personal property. Evidence from Mondragon, Emilia-Romagna shows 20-40% lower unemployment during downturns = stable housing markets.

#### 2. **"Will rental prices go up or down?"**
**Answer**: Likely decrease with housing cooperatives. Berlin co-ops: 30-40% lower rent than private. Vienna: 60% cooperative housing keeps entire market affordable. Not forced, just competitive alternatives.

#### 3. **"Do I lose my rental property?"**
**Answer**: No. Worker democracy focuses on workplace ownership, not seizing property. Voluntary evolution through economic choice. Examples: Basque Country, Northern Italy have thriving private + cooperative coexistence.

#### 4. **"How does transition work?"**
**Answer**: Gradual (20-50 years), voluntary, incentive-based. Tax benefits, financing, market competition. Italian Marcora Law: 257 buyouts, 9,300 jobs saved, 94% success rate. No revolution, just evolution.

#### 5. **"What about my 401k?"**
**Answer**: More secure. Democratic workplaces: 80% lower failure rate = stable markets. Credit unions survived 2008 better than banks. Employee-owned companies outperformed S&P 500 by 2-4% annually (2002-2020).

#### 6. **"Do small business owners lose businesses?"**
**Answer**: No - you have options. Sell to workers (20-30% higher prices), gradual profit-sharing, keep current structure, or hybrid models. Bob's Red Mill: $100M sale to employees = win-win-win.

#### 7. **"Everyone earns the same wage?"**
**Answer**: NO. Wages reflect skills, responsibility, performance. Difference: fair ratios. Traditional CEO: 300-500× median worker. Worker co-op: 3-10× highest to lowest. Mondragon: $24k entry → $72k CEO (1:3 ratio).

#### 8. **"Must I participate in decisions?"**
**Answer**: Voluntary. Vote on major issues (5-10 min/quarter), automatic profit shares, optional committee involvement. Like voting in elections - participate when it matters to you.

#### 9. **"What about my union benefits?"**
**Answer**: Unions strengthened, not replaced. Get collective bargaining PLUS ownership. Real example: CHCA (NYC) - 2,000+ workers, unionized + worker-owned. Both protections together.

#### 10. **"Does democracy kill innovation?"**
**Answer**: No - 25% MORE patents per capita than traditional firms. Workers innovate when they benefit. Mondragon: 14 research centers, €150M+ R&D, global leader in robotics, 60+ years of innovation.
