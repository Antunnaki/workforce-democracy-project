## ❓ FAQ

### What if it still looks purple?
That's actually helpful information! Take the screenshot anyway - it tells us JavaScript is definitely overriding the styles.

### What if the page doesn't load?
Try:
- Clearing Safari cache
- Opening in private mode
- Refreshing the page

### Should I test on the main page too?
Not yet - test this simplified page first so we have a baseline.
