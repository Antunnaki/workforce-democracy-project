## ✅ What to Test After Deployment

### 1. Basic UI Test
1. Go to your site: https://workforcedemocracyproject.org
2. Navigate to **Civic Engagement** section
3. Click **"My Reps"** tab
4. Verify you see:
   - Privacy disclosure (blue box with lock icon)
   - ZIP code input field
   - "Find Reps" button
   - "Need precise local representatives?" toggle

### 2. Representative Lookup Test
1. Enter ZIP code: **90210**
2. Click **"Find Reps"**
3. Wait for results (1-2 seconds)
4. Verify you see:
   - Location bar at top (minimized)
   - 3 representative cards displayed
   - Each card shows: name, title, party, contact info
   - "Voting Record" and "Contact" buttons

### 3. Privacy Test
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Type: `localStorage.getItem('wdp_civic_location')`
3. Verify: Output is encrypted (long base64 string)
4. Should NOT be plain text

### 4. Mobile Test
1. Open site on phone
2. Test same flow as above
3. Verify: UI is readable and buttons are touchable

### 5. Console Test
Open browser console and look for:
```
🔍 [V36.10.0] civic-representative-finder.js loading...
✅ [V36.10.0] civic-representative-finder.js loaded successfully
🔍 [RepFinder] Initializing...
✅ [RepFinder] Initialized successfully
```

**No errors should appear!**

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

**What's Encrypted:**
- ✅ User's ZIP code
- ✅ Full address (if provided)
- ✅ Representative data cache
- ✅ All stored in localStorage with AES-256-GCM

**What's NOT Encrypted:**
- ✅ Backend only receives ZIP code (no PII)
- ✅ Representative data (it's public information)

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- ✅ No tracking cookies
- ✅ No third-party analytics
- ✅ No server-side PII storage
- ✅ User owns all their data
- ✅ Can change location anytime

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Phase 1)

### Mock Data (Temporary)
- Backend currently returns **mock representative data**
- Shows 2 senators + 1 house rep (generic names)
- **Phase 2 will implement real Congress.gov API calls**

### Placeholder Buttons
- "Voting Record" button - shows alert (coming soon)
- "Contact" button - shows alert (coming soon)
- **Phases 3-4 will implement these features**

### Local Representatives
- Only federal reps shown currently
- Full address input works but doesn't fetch local reps yet
- **Phase 2 will add state/local reps**

---

## 🔮 What Comes Next

### Phase 2: Real Data Integration (Next)
- Replace mock data with real Congress.gov API
- Add ZIP → Congressional District mapping
- Integrate Google Civic API for local reps
- Add representative photos
- Implement PostgreSQL caching

### Phase 3: Bill Tracking
- Create bill voting tracker
- Add note-taking for votes
- AI bill explanations
- Compare user votes with rep votes
- Calculate alignment percentages

### Phase 4: Contact Management
- AI-assisted email drafting
- Social media auto-populate (NO trackers)
- Contact history tracking
- Email templates

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Custom chart generation (LLM-powered)
- Enhanced civic dashboard
- User-prioritized metrics
- Voting pattern analysis

## 💬 Questions & Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to deploy frontend AND backend?**  
A: Yes! Frontend handles UI, backend handles API calls. Both needed for full functionality.

**Q: What if backend deployment fails?**  
A: Frontend will still work, but representative lookup will show errors. Use rollback instructions in deployment guide.

**Q: Can I test without deploying backend?**  
A: Frontend will render, but API calls will fail. You'll see error messages when trying to find representatives.

**Q: How do I update Congress.gov API key?**  
A: Edit `/var/www/workforce-backend/.env` on VPS, add `CONGRESS_GOV_API_KEY=your_key_here`

**Q: Why mock data in Phase 1?**  
A: To test the complete UI/UX flow before integrating real API. Phase 2 adds real data.

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: Representatives not displaying**  
→ Check backend logs: `pm2 logs workforce-backend`  
→ Verify endpoint added to server.js  
→ Test endpoint manually with curl

**Issue: Encryption errors**  
→ Verify security.js is loaded  
→ Check browser console for errors  
→ Clear localStorage and try again

**Issue: UI not loading**  
→ Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R  
→ Check browser console for JS errors  
→ Verify civic-representative-finder.js loaded
