# 💙 V36.9.4 - User-Friendly "Work in Progress" Notices

**Version**: V36.9.4  
**Date**: February 1, 2025  
**Type**: UX Improvement - Status Communication  
**Status**: ✅ Ready to Deploy

---

## 🎯 User Request

> "I deployed to netlify, and the nonprofit is still not working. Would it be possible to make a note on the home page, or on features which are not fully operational yet and are being worked on. I'm afraid if people come and certain things aren't working that are there, they will leave. Thank you!!"

**Problem**: Features under development might confuse users and cause them to leave if not clearly communicated.

**Solution**: Add friendly, professional notices explaining project status.
