## 🎯 Current State Assessment

### Location
- **HTML**: `index.html` lines 575-673
- **CSS**: `css/welcome-modal-v36.css`
- **JavaScript**: `index.html` lines 3660-3780 (inline)

### What's Working
✅ Modal opens on first visit  
✅ Personalization with postcode works  
✅ "Don't show again" functionality  
✅ Responsive design exists  

### Issues Identified

#### 1. **Too Much Text** (Major Issue)
- 6 information cards with dense paragraphs
- Each card has 3+ paragraphs
- Mobile users will scroll forever
- Overwhelming for first-time visitors

#### 2. **Redundant Content**
- Many features described in detail that users haven't seen yet
- Information better suited for individual sections
- Welcome modal should be brief introduction, not comprehensive guide

#### 3. **Confusing Structure**
- Mix of informational cards and interactive personalization
- Not clear what's clickable vs. informational
- User confused about what to do first

#### 4. **Missing Key Info**
- No mention of "Coming Soon" features (connects to V36.9.4 notices)
- Doesn't explain development status
- Could benefit from transparency about what's working

#### 5. **Tone Issues**
- Professional but somewhat formal
- Could be warmer and more inviting
- Doesn't convey the grassroots, community nature of project

#### 6. **Mobile UX**
- Dense text hard to read on phone
- Long scroll on small screens
- Buttons might be hard to tap

Match the grassroots, community nature of the project.
