## Subject: Request for International Access to DashScope API

Dear Alibaba Cloud Support Team,

I am writing to request assistance with accessing the DashScope API service for my project, Workforce Democracy Project.

I have been trying to access the DashScope service through the international version of Alibaba Cloud (alibabacloud.com) but have encountered an error message stating that "DashScope has not yet been released on Alibaba cloud.com(international)."

As an international customer, I would like to know if there are any alternative methods or workarounds to access the Qwen API services. I need this access to integrate AI capabilities into my civic engagement platform.

Could you please provide guidance on:
1. Any available international access options for DashScope
2. Alternative authentication methods for Qwen API
3. Recommendations for obtaining API keys as an international customer
4. Any partner programs or resellers that might assist with international access

My project is focused on promoting civic engagement and democratic participation, and I believe the Qwen AI models would greatly enhance our ability to provide accurate information to users.

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
