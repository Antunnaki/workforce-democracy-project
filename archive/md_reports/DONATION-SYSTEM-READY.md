## 💰 How Donations Work

### **For Donors:**

1. Visit your donation page
2. See Bitcoin option (active and highlighted)
3. Either:
   - **Copy the address** and paste in their wallet
   - **Scan the QR code** with their Bitcoin wallet app
4. Send Bitcoin!
5. See Ethereum/Monero marked as "Coming Soon"

### **For You:**

1. **Check Proton Wallet** to see incoming donations
2. **No action needed** - Bitcoin arrives automatically
3. **Track in wallet** - Proton Wallet shows all transactions
4. **Add more coins later** - Just give me new addresses when ready

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### **What's Public (Safe):**
- ✅ Your Bitcoin receiving address (on donation page)
- ✅ QR code of that address
- ✅ Transaction amounts (on blockchain)

### **What Stays Private:**
- ✅ Your identity (unless you tell people)
- ✅ Your private keys (never shared, never needed)
- ✅ Your other addresses (not linked)
- ✅ Your total balance (donors can't see this)

### **Best Practices:**
- ✅ Keep private keys safe
- ✅ Back up your Proton Wallet recovery phrase
- ✅ Consider moving large amounts to cold storage eventually
- ✅ Track donations for accounting (if needed)

1. **Open donate.html** on your phone
2. **Check Bitcoin section:**

## ❓ Questions You Might Have

### **"What if someone sends me Bitcoin right now?"**
It works! Your address is active. Donations can arrive anytime.

### **"Do I need to do anything when Bitcoin arrives?"**
Nope! It just appears in your Proton Wallet. You'll get a notification.

### **"Can I use this address forever?"**
Yes! Bitcoin addresses don't expire. You can use it as long as you want.

### **"What about transaction fees?"**
Donors pay the fees, not you. With SegWit (bc1), their fees are lower!

### **"How do I know if someone donated?"**
Check your Proton Wallet. You'll see incoming transactions.

Yes! You can create new addresses anytime and update the page.
