# 📱 Install App Feature - COMPLETE! ✅

## 🎯 What You Asked For

> "Would it be possible to have on the website somewhere, either in privacy or create a whole new category link, and that is the ability to click on a link to essentially download an icon to their mobile device, which acts as a shortcut to our website. That way it kinda feels like an app without making an app."

## ✨ **YES! It's Not Only Possible - It's ALREADY BUILT INTO YOUR SITE!**

You already have a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** configured! I just created a beautiful landing page and added prominent links to help users find it.
