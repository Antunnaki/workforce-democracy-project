## ✅ VERIFICATION

**After cleanup, you should have EXACTLY 30 files:**

Count your remaining .md files. You should have:
- 6 core docs
- 5 V34 files
- 4 V33 files
- 2 V32.9 files
- 6 backend files
- 4 security/debug files
- 3 testing/cleanup files

**= 30 total files** ✅

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR MOBILE CLEANUP

**Make it easier:**

1. **Work in batches** - Don't try to do all 370 files at once
2. **Take breaks** - Do 50 files at a time
3. **Double check** - Before deleting, verify it's not on the "KEEP" list
4. **Start with easy patterns** - V32.0-V32.8 is a big batch to delete first
5. **Sort by date** - Files older than Jan 24 are likely safe to delete (except the 30 keep files)

**Estimated time:**
- If deleting 1 file per 10 seconds = ~60 minutes total
- Do 100 files per day = 4 days
- Or batch delete = 30 minutes if app supports multi-select

---

## 🚨 SAFETY TIP

**Before you start deleting:**

1. **Make sure you have a backup** of your project (GitHub, cloud, etc.)
2. **Or download a copy** first
3. This way if you accidentally delete something important, you can restore it!
