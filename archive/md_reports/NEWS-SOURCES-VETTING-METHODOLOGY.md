# 📰 News Sources Vetting Methodology

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: January 13, 2026  
**Purpose**: Transparency in news source selection

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

The Workforce Democracy Project provides a curated news feed from **independent, factually accurate, and ethically transparent** news organizations. This document explains exactly how we select and vet our sources.

---

## ✅ Inclusion Criteria

To be included in our news feed, a source **must meet ALL** of these requirements:

### 1. Factual Accuracy ⭐ (MANDATORY)
- **Minimum Rating**: "High Factual Accuracy" or above
- **Verification Source**: [Media Bias/Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/)
- **Why**: Factual accuracy is non-negotiable for informed civic participation

### 2. Editorial Transparency 📋 (MANDATORY)
- **Funding Disclosure**: Clearly states funding sources on website
- **Ownership Transparency**: Discloses who owns/controls the organization
- **Editorial Independence**: States editorial policies publicly
- **Why**: Readers deserve to know who funds the news they read

### 3. Corrections Policy ✏️ (MANDATORY)
- **Publishes Corrections**: Has public corrections/retractions policy
- **Acknowledges Errors**: Corrects mistakes promptly and visibly
- **Why**: All journalists make mistakes; ethical ones own up to them

### 4. Accessibility 🌐 (MANDATORY)
- **No Hard Paywall**: Free tier available OR no paywall
- **Ethical Paywalls OK**: Reader-supported models (donations/subscriptions) are fine if basic news is free
- **Why**: Information should be accessible to all, regardless of income

### 5. Source Attribution 🔗 (MANDATORY)
- **Cites Sources**: Clearly attributes information to sources
- **Links to Evidence**: Provides links to original documents/data when possible
- **Why**: Verifiable journalism requires transparent sourcing

### 6. Independence 🗽 (MANDATORY)
- **Not State-Controlled**: Not owned/controlled by government
- **Exception**: Public-funded broadcasters OK if editorially independent (BBC, NPR, ABC)
- **Why**: Independent journalism holds power accountable

## 📊 Bias Transparency

We **do not exclude sources based on political bias**, as long as they meet factual accuracy standards. Instead, we:

1. ✅ **Label bias clearly** - Every source shows its bias rating
2. ✅ **Prioritize accuracy** - Factual accuracy matters more than political leaning
3. ✅ **Include diverse perspectives** - Left, center, and right sources (all factually accurate)
4. ✅ **Let users choose** - Filter by category, not by our preferences

### Bias Rating Scale (Media Bias/Fact Check)
- **Left**: Progressive/liberal perspective
- **Left-Center**: Slightly left-leaning
- **Least Biased**: Minimal editorial bias
- **Right-Center**: Slightly right-leaning
- **Right**: Conservative perspective

**All sources must have "High" or "Very High" factual accuracy regardless of bias.**

---

## 🚫 Exclusion Criteria

We **will not include** sources that:

❌ **Spread Misinformation**: Low factual accuracy rating  
❌ **State Propaganda**: Government-controlled media without editorial independence  
❌ **Conspiracy Sites**: Promote conspiracy theories or pseudoscience  
❌ **Hard Paywalls**: All content locked behind paywall  
❌ **Opaque Funding**: Refuse to disclose funding sources  
❌ **No Corrections**: Never publish corrections or retractions  
❌ **Surveillance Capitalism**: Heavy tracking/data harvesting (privacy violation)

---

## 🔄 Quarterly Review Process

Every **3 months**, we re-review all sources:

### What We Check:
1. ✅ Factual accuracy rating still "High" or above
2. ✅ No major scandals or ethical violations
3. ✅ RSS feed still functional
4. ✅ Website still free/accessible
5. ✅ Corrections policy still published

### What Happens If a Source Declines:
