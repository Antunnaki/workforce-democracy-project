# V32.5 - Civic Tab Reordering ✅

**Date**: January 24, 2025  
**Version**: V32.5  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 📋 User Request

"For the civic transparency section, could you please have my reps as number one and candidates as number two on the top row. I think those are the two most impactful modules initially. The bills come after that i feel. Plus it will make the manual scroll down the home screen shorter."

**User's Reasoning**:
1. **My Reps** - Most important initially (know who represents you)
2. **Candidates** - Second most important (who's running for office)
3. **Vote on Bills** - Comes after understanding representatives
4. **Supreme Court** & **Dashboard** - Supporting features

**Goal**: Reduce scrolling, prioritize most impactful modules

    <button class="civic-tab active" 
            data-tab="representatives" 
            onclick="switchCivicTab('representatives')">
        <span class="tab-icon">👥</span>
        <span class="tab-label">My Reps</span>
    </button>
    
    <!-- Tab 2: Candidates (now second) -->
    <button class="civic-tab" 
            data-tab="candidates">
        <span class="tab-icon">🗳️</span>
        <span class="tab-label">Candidates</span>
    </button>
    
    <!-- Tab 3: Vote on Bills (now third) -->
    <button class="civic-tab"

        <span class="tab-icon">📜</span>
        <span class="tab-label">Vote on Bills</span>
    </button>
    
    <!-- Tabs 4-5: Court & Dashboard unchanged -->

## 💡 Why This Matters

### Political Engagement Theory:
1. **Personal Connection First**: "Who represents ME?" is the most engaging entry point
2. **Then Future Options**: "Who's running?" comes naturally after knowing current reps
3. **Then Legislation**: Understanding bills is easier after knowing who votes on them
4. **Then Context**: Court decisions and dashboards provide deeper context

### User Psychology:
- **Immediate Relevance**: "My Reps" is personal and local
- **Reduced Overwhelm**: Starting with familiar (your reps) before complex (bills)
- **Natural Curiosity**: "Who represents me?" → "Who else is running?" → "What are they voting on?"

---

## 🎉 Success Metrics

### Before (V32.4):
- ❓ Bills shown first (less personally relevant)
- ❓ Reps and Candidates buried in tabs
- ❓ Users might skip past to find their reps

### After (V32.5):
- ✅ Reps shown first (most personally relevant)
- ✅ Candidates immediately accessible (second tab)
- ✅ Natural engagement flow: Personal → Elections → Legislation
- ✅ **Shorter scroll path to most-used features**
- ✅ **Better first impression** (immediate personalization)
