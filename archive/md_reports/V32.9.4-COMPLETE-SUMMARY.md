## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Civic Tab Centering (Request 1) ✅

- Margins reset at tablet+ breakpoints

**Visual Result:**
```
BEFORE:                        AFTER:
Row 1: [Court] [Reps] [Bills]  Row 1: [Court] [Reps] [Bills]
Row 2: [Cands] [Dashboard]     Row 2:    [Cands] [Dashboard]
       ↑ Left-aligned ❌              ↑ CENTERED! ✅
```

### 2. Chat Widget Standardization (Request 2) ✅

## 💡 Technical Details (If You're Curious)

### Architecture Pattern Used:
```
Container: .{section}-chat-top
  └─ Toggle Button: .{section}-chat-toggle-top
  └─ Chat Window: .{section}-chat-window-top
      ├─ Header: .{section}-chat-header-top
      ├─ Messages: .{section}-chat-messages-top
      └─ Input Container: .{section}-chat-input-container-top
```

Where `{section}` = `jobs`, `civic`, or `ethical`

### Why This Approach?
1. **Unique Classes:** No CSS conflicts between chats
2. **Consistent Pattern:** Same structure for all 3
3. **Easy Maintenance:** Update one pattern, apply to all
4. **Scalable:** Easy to add more chat widgets in future
