## 🎯 User Feedback

> "It's still very large. Should you start from scratch? There are multiple layers and probably multiple conflicts. There could also be something on the root. This was built prior to our deep debugging adventures. Thank you!"

## ✅ Solution: Complete Rebuild

**You were absolutely right!** The old CSS had too many layers, conflicts, and legacy bloat from before all the debugging sessions. 

### What I Did:

**Created brand new minimal CSS from scratch** - `css/onboarding-minimal.css`

- ✅ No legacy code
- ✅ No conflicting layers
- ✅ Ultra-compact design
- ✅ Mobile-first approach
- ✅ Only 6.9KB (vs 11.7KB old file)

## 🎨 Design Approach

### Old (Bloated):
```css
.feature-card {
    background: white;
    border: 2px solid #f4f4f4;
    border-radius: 12px;
    padding: 1.25rem;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
    cursor: default;
}
```

### New (Minimal):
```css
.feature-card {
    background: #f9f9f9;
    border: 1px solid #e8e8e8;
    border-radius: 6px;
    padding: 0.5rem 0.625rem;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 0.5rem;
}
```

**Difference:**
- 60% less padding
- 50% thinner borders
- 50% smaller border-radius
- Simpler background
- Direct flex layout
