## 🎯 Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Header Formatting - FIXED

**Problem:**
- Header HTML existed but had no styling
- Only raw links were visible
- No structure, branding, or professional appearance

**Solution:**
```html
<header style="background: white; border-bottom: 2px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1); padding: 1rem 0; position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 1000;">
    <div class="container" style="max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 2rem;">
        <nav style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;">
            <a href="/" class="logo" style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: 700; color: #FF6B35; text-decoration: none;">
                🏛️ Workforce Democracy
            </a>
            <ul class="nav-links" style="display: flex; gap: 2rem; list-style: none;">
                <!-- Navigation links with proper styling -->
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </div>
</header>
```

**Mobile Responsive:**
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    header nav ul.nav-links {
        display: none !important;
    }
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Professional header with proper logo styling
- ✅ Sticky positioning at top of page
- ✅ Clean navigation links with proper spacing
- ✅ Hides on mobile to prevent overflow
- ✅ Matches main site aesthetic

### 2. ✅ Video Tutorials Section - REMOVED

**Problem:**
- Page claimed "Video tutorials coming soon!"
- No plans to create videos (would require AI generation)
- Sets false expectations

**Solution:**
```html
<!-- REMOVED ENTIRE SECTION -->
<!-- 
<div class="video-placeholder">
    <i class="fas fa-video"></i>
    <p>Video tutorials coming soon!</p>
    <p>We're creating step-by-step video guides for each platform</p>
</div>
-->
```

**Result:**
- ✅ No misleading promises
- ✅ Cleaner page layout
- ✅ Focus on existing written instructions
- ✅ No commitment to video content creation

---

### 3. ✅ Marketing Copy - MADE FACTUALLY ACCURATE

**Problem:**
```html
<!-- OLD - INACCURATE -->
<p>
    Join thousands of users who've installed our app for instant access to 
    democratic workplace resources and civic transparency tools.
</p>
```

**Solution:**
```html
<!-- NEW - ACCURATE -->
<p style="font-size: 1.25rem; opacity: 0.95; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
    Get instant access to democratic workplace resources and civic transparency 
    tools right from your home screen.
</p>
```

**Result:**
- ✅ No inflated user numbers
- ✅ Focus on real benefits
- ✅ Honest, straightforward messaging
- ✅ Still compelling and action-oriented
