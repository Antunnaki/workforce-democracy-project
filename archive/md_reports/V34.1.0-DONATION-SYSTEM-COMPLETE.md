### 3. Privacy-First Approach

**Why Crypto Only:**
- Traditional processors (Stripe, PayPal, Patreon) require tracking

- Crypto maintains 100% privacy commitment

**Future Card Payments:**
- Note about waiting for Proton's privacy-focused system
- No compromise on values for convenience
- Will add when ethical option available

### 4. Messaging That Works

**Tone Used:**
> "This project is built by a solo developer with support from a growing community. Together, we're creating tools for transparency and worker empowerment that will always remain free and accessible to everyone."

**What It Communicates:**
- ✅ Honesty (solo dev, not "small team")
- ✅ Community (acknowledges support)
- ✅ Mission-focused (tools for empowerment)
- ✅ Values (free and accessible forever)
- ✅ Dignity (not begging)

**What It Avoids:**
- ❌ Desperation
- ❌ Guilt trips
- ❌ Oversharing personal struggles
- ❌ "Save us" mentality
- ❌ Pressure tactics
