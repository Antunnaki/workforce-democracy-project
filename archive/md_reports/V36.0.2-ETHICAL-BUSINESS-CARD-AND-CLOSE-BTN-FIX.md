### 2. Fixed Close Button Visibility

**Problem:** Close button (X) in top-right corner was too transparent and hard to see

**Solution:** Increased opacity and added shadow for better visibility

**CSS Changes:**

```css
/* BEFORE */
.wdp-welcome-close {
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* Too transparent */
}

.wdp-welcome-close:hover {
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Still faint */
}

/* AFTER */
.wdp-welcome-close {
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); /* 3x more visible */
    box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); /* Added depth */
}

.wdp-welcome-close:hover {
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* 2.5x more visible */
    box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); /* Stronger shadow */
}
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Background opacity increased from 10% → 30% (default)
- ✅ Hover opacity increased from 20% → 50%
- ✅ Added box-shadow for depth and contrast
- ✅ Stronger shadow on hover for better feedback
- ✅ Maintains rotation animation on hover
