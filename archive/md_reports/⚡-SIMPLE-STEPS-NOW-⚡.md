# ⚡ SIMPLE STEPS - DO THIS NOW

## 🎯 YOU'RE 3 STEPS AWAY FROM TESTING

Since you already use Netlify for production, this will be easy!

---

## STEP 1: Make Sure You Have These Files

Download from this chat if needed:
- ✅ `index.html` (I updated it with script tag)
- ✅ `js/test-backend-override.js` (I created this)

Put them in your project folder (replace old `index.html` with new one).

---

## STEP 2: Create Test Site on Netlify

1. Go to: **https://app.netlify.com/**
2. Click: **"Add new site"**
3. Click: **"Deploy manually"**
4. **Drag your entire project folder** onto the upload area
5. Wait 30 seconds

You'll get a URL like: `random-words-123.netlify.app`

---

## STEP 3: Test It

1. **Open your new test URL**
2. **Press F12** (opens console)
3. **Look for this:**
   ```
   🔧 [TEST OVERRIDE] Redirecting API calls to Version B
   ```
4. **Find Chuck Schumer** (or any rep)
5. **Ask in chat:**
   ```
   What is Chuck Schumer's voting record on healthcare?
   ```
6. **Check console** for:
   ```
   Deep research returned 11 sources
   ```

---

## ✅ SUCCESS = You See:
- ✅ Override message in console
- ✅ "Deep research returned 11 sources"
- ✅ 7-11 actual Congress.gov bills
- ✅ Clickable citations [1] [2] [3]
- ✅ Real healthcare legislation info

---

## ❌ FAILURE = You See:
- ❌ No override message
- ❌ Only 1-2 sources
- ❌ Generic "I searched but didn't find" response
- ❌ Random RSS articles (not bills)

---

## 🐛 IF PROBLEMS:

**No console messages?**
→ Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Mac: Cmd+Shift+R)

**Still nothing?**
→ Incognito window: Ctrl+Shift+N

**Override shows but no deep research?**
→ Screenshot console and send me

---

## 📞 REPORT BACK

Tell me:
1. Your test site URL
2. Did you see the override message?
3. What response did you get?
4. How many sources?

**That's it! 3 steps. Let's see if deep research works! 🚀**
