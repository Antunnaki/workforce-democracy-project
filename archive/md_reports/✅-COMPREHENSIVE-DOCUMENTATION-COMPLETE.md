## 🔑 KEY INFORMATION CAPTURED

### 1. Civic Engagement Platform

**Representative Tracking**:
```
Status: ✅ Fully implemented (v36.11.x)
APIs: Congress.gov (US Federal), OpenStates (US States)

Features: ZIP search, official photos, direct contact, 180-day cache
```

**Bill Voting & Alignment**:
```
Status: ✅ Fully implemented (client-side, encrypted)
Storage: localStorage with AES-256-GCM encryption
Features: Vote Yes/No/Abstain, see aligned/opposed reps, track by issue

```

**Guided Learning**:
```
Status: ✅ Implemented via LLM integration
AI: GROQ Llama 3.3 70B for bill analysis
Features: Pattern detection, personalized recommendations, adaptive complexity
```

### 2. Democratic Socialism Philosophy

**Core Principles**:
- Workers control companies and wealth (not shareholders)
- Every worker is a shareholder with **equal voting rights**
- No wealthy owners siphoning money to investors
- Decisions made democratically by those who do the work

### 3. Adaptive Language System

**Implementation**:
```javascript
Knowledge Levels: beginner | intermediate | advanced

Detection Based On:
- Questions asked (technical vs basic)
- Time spent on resources
- Bills viewed (complex vs simple)
- Voting patterns (nuanced vs binary)

Response Adaptation:
- Vocabulary complexity
- Sentence length
- Use of examples
- Technical terms (avoided/explained/used)
```

**Application Areas**:
- Bill summaries (plain language + detail expansion)
- FAQ responses (auto-adjusted)
- Chat assistant (detects question sophistication)
- Learning resources (recommended by difficulty)
- Jobs comparisons (simple + detailed)
