# ✅ V36.11.7 Testing Guide - Cache Issues

## What Changed

**V36.11.7 updates:**
1. ✅ More aggressive cache-busting parameters
2. ✅ Version verification logs in rep-finder-simple.js
3. ✅ Clearer console output

## Step-by-Step Testing

### Step 1: Publish to GenSpark
Click "Publish Project" and wait for confirmation.

### Step 2: NUCLEAR Cache Clear

**Option A - Incognito Mode (BEST):**
1. Open a NEW Incognito/Private Window
2. Go to your GenSpark site URL
3. This bypasses ALL cache

**Option B - Hard Refresh:**
1. Close ALL browser tabs with your site
2. Clear browser history (last hour)
3. Restart browser completely
4. Open site fresh

**Option C - Different Browser:**
1. If you've been using Safari, try Chrome
2. Or vice versa
3. Completely fresh cache

### Step 3: Check Console Logs

Open F12 → Console, look for:

```javascript
// Should see BOTH of these NEW logs:
🚀 [REP-FINDER-SIMPLE V36.11.7] Loading with contrast fixes...
📊 [REP-FINDER-SIMPLE V36.11.7] Statistics will use DARK overlays with WHITE text
```

**If you see V36.11.7** → New version loaded! ✅  
**If you still see V36.11.2** → Cache still stuck ❌

### Step 4: Check Statistics Header

After searching for ZIP 92101, look at the purple gradient header:

**What you should see with V36.11.7:**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎯 Found 7 Representatives            │
│                                       │
│  ╔════════╗  ╔════════╗              │
│  ║   2    ║  ║   5    ║              │  ← WHITE numbers
│  ║ Federal║  ║ State  ║              │  ← WHITE text
│  ╚════════╝  ╚════════╝              │  ← Dark boxes
│                                       │
│  ✓ Sources: [Congress.gov] [OpenStates] │
└───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Dark overlay style:**
- Background: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)` (dark semi-transparent)
- Border: `2px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)` (white outline)
- Text: White with text-shadow
- Numbers: Large, bold, white

**What you might still see (OLD version):**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎯 Found 7 Representatives            │
│                                       │
│  [barely visible]  [barely visible]  │  ← Light purple on purple
│  [   numbers   ]  [   numbers    ]   │  ← Can't see text
│                                       │
└───────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 5: Inspect Element (Advanced)

1. Right-click on the "2 Federal" box
2. Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
3. Look at the computed styles for the box
4. Check the `background` property:
   - **V36.11.7**: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)` ✅
   - **OLD**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)` ❌

### Step 6: Direct File Access

Try accessing the JavaScript file directly:

```
https://sxcrlfyt.gensparkspace.com/js/rep-finder-simple.js?v=36.11.7-FORCE-RELOAD&nocache=1&t=1730598888
```

Search (Ctrl+F) for:
- `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)` ← Should find this (dark overlay)
- `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)` ← Should NOT find this (old light overlay)

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Published V36.11.7 to GenSpark
- [ ] Opened site in Incognito/Private mode
- [ ] Console shows `[REP-FINDER-SIMPLE V36.11.7]` logs
- [ ] Searched for ZIP 92101
- [ ] Statistics header boxes are DARK (not light)
- [ ] Numbers "2" and "5" are clearly visible in WHITE
- [ ] Source badges are visible
- [ ] All 7 representative cards display

## What to Report Back

### If Statistics Are NOW Visible:
✅ "Statistics are now visible! Numbers are white on dark backgrounds."
→ Cache issue resolved!

### If Statistics Are STILL Invisible:
❌ "Still can't see the numbers clearly. They look [describe color]."
→ Include:
1. Screenshot of the header
2. Console output (full log showing V36.11.7 or not)
3. Result of Element Inspection (what background color shows?)
4. Browser you're using (Safari? Chrome?)

### If V36.11.7 Logs Don't Show:
⚠️ "Console still shows V36.11.2"
→ Extreme cache issue. May need file rename strategy.

## Representative Cards Issue

Please also clarify:

1. **How many cards display?** (You should see 7 total)
2. **Which representatives are showing?**
   - Adam Schiff (Senator) ✅ (confirmed in screenshot)
   - Alex Padilla (Senator) ?
   - Aisha Wahab (State Senator) ?
   - Others?
3. **Are they cut off, or just not rendering?**
4. **Can you scroll down to see more?**

## Expected Results

After V36.11.7 + Incognito mode:

1. ✅ Console shows V36.11.7 version logs
2. ✅ Chat button works (already confirmed working!)
3. ✅ Statistics header has high contrast white text on dark backgrounds
4. ✅ All 7 representative cards display
5. ✅ Photos load (or show gradient initials if CSP blocks them)
6. ✅ Contact buttons work (phone, email, website)

**Most Important:** Try Incognito/Private mode first! This is the most reliable way to bypass cache issues.
