## ✅ What I Did for You

I've ensured all CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) security allowances are properly configured so your GenSpark testing link works perfectly with all features!

### Files Updated:
✅ **`_headers`** - Added `https://*.gensparkspace.com` to CORS whitelist

### Already Configured (No Changes Needed):
✅ **`index.html`** - GenSpark support already present  
✅ **Backend Nginx** - Your specific URL already whitelisted
