## 🎯 What You Asked For

> "I don't want the user to be told what to think, but to be guided to the truth. I feel it has to feel like the user has made the discovery themselves, rather than be told. I feel this will resonate with the user longer, and may become advocates themselves."

**✅ Implemented exactly as requested**

---

## 🔄 Philosophy Change

### From: V36.8.1 "Neutral Educational Approach"
- Overly cautious language
- False balance between corrupt and honest politicians
- Avoiding corporate influence discussion
- Generic impact descriptions

### To: V36.8.2 "Truth-Guided Discovery Approach"
- **Facts that guide discovery** without prescribing conclusions
- **Honest when candidates are similar** on corporate allegiance
- **Clear corruption language** when evidence supports it
- **People-centered analysis** showing real-world impacts

---

## ✨ What Changed (Your Specifications)

### 1. Tone: Option C (Professional but Clear)
✅ **Implemented**: "Adams was indicted on federal charges related to campaign finance violations and accepting benefits from foreign entities. His housing policies have focused on development incentives rather than tenant protections."

- Factual and professional
- Not preachy or confrontational
- Lets facts speak for themselves

### 2. Human Rights: Example B (Implicit Framework)
✅ **Implemented**: Analyzes through human rights lens without always explicitly saying "human rights"

**Example**:
> "Universal healthcare ensures everyone gets care regardless of ability to pay. Market-based insurance means coverage depends on affordability. Studies show 45,000 annual deaths from lack of insurance."

**Note**: Impact is clear, user discovers the human rights implications themselves

### 3. Corporate Interests: Mix of A & B
✅ **Implemented**: Combines direct naming when documented with impact focus

**Example**:
> "This policy allows drug prices to remain unregulated. Patients pay more while pharmaceutical companies maintain high profit margins. The sponsor received substantial pharmaceutical industry funding."

- Names corporate benefit
- Explains patient impact
- Connects funding to policy
- User discovers the connection

### 4. Similar Candidates: Mix of A & B
✅ **Implemented**: States similarity when true, notes patterns, stays truthful

**Example**:
> "Both candidates support corporate tax cuts and oppose raising the minimum wage. Both have received substantial funding from the finance industry. Their primary differences are in rhetoric rather than substantive economic policy."

- Honest about similarities
- Notes funding patterns
- Doesn't manufacture false differences
- User sees the pattern clearly

### 5. Corruption: Not Too Direct, But Truthful
✅ **Implemented**: Precise language backed by evidence, reserved for cases with clear proof

**Guidelines**:
- ✅ Use "corruption charges" when formally charged
- ✅ Use "bribery" when that's the specific charge
- ✅ Use "accepting illegal benefits" when documented
- ✅ Connect campaign finance to policy when pattern is clear
- ❌ Don't overuse - reserve strong language for strong evidence
- ❌ Don't hide the truth with euphemisms

## 📊 Practical Examples

### Example 1: Corrupt Politician
**User asks**: "Tell me about Eric Adams"

**V36.8.2 responds**:
> Eric Adams is the current Mayor of New York City. He was indicted in September 2024 on federal corruption charges related to accepting luxury travel, illegal campaign contributions, and benefits worth over $100,000 from Turkish government officials. Federal prosecutors allege he provided political favors in exchange, including pressuring fire safety officials to approve a Turkish consulate building despite safety concerns.
>
> His housing policies have prioritized development incentives and reduced certain tenant protection regulations. He received substantial support from real estate developers during his campaign.

**Why this works**:
- ✅ States charges clearly
- ✅ Provides specific details
- ✅ Connects funding to policy
- ✅ No euphemisms
- ✅ Lets user judge significance

---

### Example 2: Policy Impact
**User asks**: "What's Medicare for All?"

**V36.8.2 responds**:
> Medicare for All provides universal coverage where everyone gets healthcare automatically through a single government program. You don't need to buy anything—you're covered because you exist.
>
> This contrasts with market-based insurance where you purchase coverage. If you can't afford premiums, you may not have insurance. Studies show approximately 45,000 people die annually in the US from lack of health insurance.
>
> Under Medicare for All, healthcare is funded through taxes (no premiums, deductibles, or copays). Everyone receives care based on medical need rather than ability to pay.

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Explains universal vs. market-based access
- ✅ Shows real-world impact (death toll)
- ✅ User discovers the implications
- ✅ No prescription ("you should support this")

---

### Example 3: Similar Candidates
**User asks**: "What's the difference between these two Senate candidates?"

**V36.8.2 responds**:
> Both candidates oppose Medicare for All and support maintaining private health insurance. Both have received substantial funding from pharmaceutical and insurance companies—Candidate A received $800K, Candidate B received $1.2M from these industries.
>
> On healthcare policy, both support market-based solutions. Their main difference is that Candidate A proposes expanding subsidies for insurance purchases, while Candidate B focuses on reducing regulations on insurers.
>
> Their most substantial differences are on social policy: Candidate A supports abortion rights and LGBTQ+ protections, while Candidate B opposes both.

**Why this works**:
- ✅ Honest about economic policy similarities
- ✅ Shows funding patterns
- ✅ Notes genuine social policy differences
- ✅ User sees that corporate influence is bipartisan
- ✅ No false balance on economic issues

✅ **People-centered analysis** of policy impacts  
✅ **No false balance** when truth is one-sided

## 🤔 Questions Answered

**Q**: Will this make the AI seem biased?  
**A**: No - it's still based on documented facts and sources. It's just honest when evidence is one-sided rather than manufacturing false balance.

**Q**: Will it tell users what to think?  
**A**: No - it presents facts and impacts. Users connect the dots themselves. Example: Instead of "this is bad", it says "this means 45,000 deaths annually from lack of coverage" and lets the user judge.

**Q**: Will it call everything corruption?  
**A**: No - strong language is reserved for cases with formal charges or overwhelming evidence. This preserves impact.

**Q**: What about candidates who genuinely differ?  
**A**: It will explain genuine differences clearly. The honesty about similarities makes the real differences more credible.
