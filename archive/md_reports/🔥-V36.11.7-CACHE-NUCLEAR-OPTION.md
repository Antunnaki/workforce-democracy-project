# V36.11.7 - Nuclear Cache Busting Option

## The Problem

The contrast fixes ARE in the code, but your browser/CDN is stubbornly caching the old version despite version query parameters.

## Current Situation

✅ **Chat button works!** (Syntax fixes successful)  
❌ **Statistics header still low contrast** (cache issue)  
❓ **Representative cards display issue** (need clarification)

## The Nuclear Option: Rename the File

If cache-busting with query parameters doesn't work, we can **rename the actual file**:

### Option A: Rename File (Most Aggressive)
```
OLD: js/rep-finder-simple.js?v=36.11.6
NEW: js/rep-finder-simple-v36.js (completely new filename)
```

This FORCES the browser to download a new file because it's literally a different URL.

### Option B: Add Random Timestamp
```html
<script src="js/rep-finder-simple.js?v=36.11.7&cache=break&t=<?php echo time(); ?>"></script>
```

### Option C: Use #hash Instead of ?query
```html
<script src="js/rep-finder-simple.js#36.11.7"></script>
```

## What I Need From You

Please clarify:

1. **Statistics Header Color Issue:**
   - Can you see the numbers "2" and "5" at all?
   - What color are they? (light purple? white? dark?)
   - Take a screenshot and use a color picker tool

2. **Representative Cards:**
   - Is ONLY Schiff showing?
   - Or are there more cards below if you scroll down?
   - How many cards do you see total?

3. **Cache Testing:**
   - Try opening the page in **Incognito/Private mode**
   - Does the statistics header look different there?
   - If yes → Cache issue confirmed
   - If no → The fixes haven't been deployed

## Immediate Action

Let me update to V36.11.7 with a more aggressive cache-busting timestamp:
