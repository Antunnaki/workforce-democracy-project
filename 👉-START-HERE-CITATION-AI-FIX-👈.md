# 👉 START HERE: Citation + AI Response Fix

## 🚨 ISSUE YOU REPORTED

> "I had working citations for only a very short period of time. they've either not come through, or hallucinated. async broke a phenomenal response... when I tried to fix that, I lost the great response and have not been able to get either back."

## ✅ SOLUTION FOUND

**Problem**: Frontend async code extracting from wrong JSON path  
**Fix**: One-line change in `js/chat-clean.js`  
**Result**: Both AI responses AND citations will work together

## 🎯 WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

   - [ ] Some AI response (how many words?)
   - [ ] Citations visible? (¹ ² ³ or [1] [2] [3]?)
   - [ ] How many sources listed at bottom?
